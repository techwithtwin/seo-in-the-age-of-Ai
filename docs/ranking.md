## What is Ranking?

**Ranking** refers to the position where your web page appears in search engine results for a given keyword or query.

A higher ranking means more visibility, more clicks, and more potential traffic.

Search Engines use **ranking factors** to decide which page deserves to appear first.

While Google's exact algorithm is secret, the most important factors fall into several key categories.

## Factors affecting ranking

### 1. **Domain Authority (DA)**

- It was developed by Moz, **DA** predicts how well a website will rank on search engines.
- It is based on the quality and number of inbound links ( backlinks ).
- Higher DA -> greater potential to rank better.
- The advice is to focus on earning links from reputable, relevant websites.

E.g a `.edu` backlink or mention from a trusted industry blog is worth more than 10 random directory links.

### 2. **Page Authority (PA)**

- It was also created by Moz, **PA** measures the strength of a **single page**

### 3. **Bounce Rate & Engagement**

- **Bounce Rate** = the percentage of visitors who leave after only viewing one page.
- A high bounc rate signals that users didn't find what they expected.

:::tip
