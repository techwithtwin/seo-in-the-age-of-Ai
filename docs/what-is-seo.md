# What is SEO

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of optimizing your website so that it can be easily **found** by people searching for products, services, or information online.

In simple terms, SEO ensures your website is **"findable"** on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.

## 🔍 How Search Engines work

Search engines work by matching what people search for with the **most relevant and high-quality content** available on the web.

Let’s take an example:

Suppose your website sells **mugs**.

Now imagine a potential customer searches for:

> “Best mugs in Kenya”  
> “Mugs near me”  
> “Mugs in Westlands”  
> “Branded mugs for sale”  
> “Mug printing in Nairobi”

If your website contains those **keywords** and **relevant descriptions**, Google can easily connect your site with that searcher.

But if your website is missing those keywords or if your descriptions are vague or unrelated Google won’t know your site is about mugs, and you **won’t appear** in search results.

**In short:**

> If search engines can’t understand your content, they can’t show it to the right people.

:::tip
Search engines use automated programs called **bots** (or **crawlers**) to discover and match content based on the words and topics they find.

## ⏱️ Do search engines crawl in Real Time?

You might wonder, if Google matches your website to millions of searches every second, how does it do it so fast?

The answer is: **it doesn’t happen in real-time.**

Search engines go through a process called **crawling** and **indexing**.

:::info
**Crawling** is when search engines send out bots to periodically scan websites and collect information about their pages.  
**Indexing** is when that information is stored and organized so it can appear in search results.
:::

So when someone searches for “best mugs in Kenya,” Google isn’t crawling your site right then it’s retrieving results from its **index**, a massive library of web pages it has already scanned.

That’s why it’s so important to:

- Keep your website up to date
- Use relevant keywords
- Make sure your site is crawlable and indexable
