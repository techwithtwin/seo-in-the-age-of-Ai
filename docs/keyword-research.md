# Keyword Research

**Keyword research** is the process of finding and analyzing the words and phrases people use when searching online.

It helps you understand **what your audience wants**, and **how** they’re searching for it so you can create content that meets their intent.

> In simple terms: Keyword research helps you speak the same language as your customers.

## 🔍 Why Keyword Research Matters

Search engines use keywords to match content with search queries.  
If your website includes the right keywords naturally in your content, titles, and metadata — you increase your chances of appearing in relevant searches.

Without keyword research, you’re basically guessing what your audience wants.

## 🧠 How to Do Keyword Research

### 1. **Manual Research**

Start by typing your main product or service into Google and observe:

- **Autocomplete suggestions** (what Google predicts)
- **Related searches** (shown at the bottom of the page)
- **People also ask** boxes

These are real, data-backed search phrases that people are using right now.

**Example:**  
If you sell mugs, try typing:

> “Mugs for…” → Google may suggest _“Mugs for gifts”, “Mugs for office”, “Mugs for couples”_, etc.

Those are your potential keyword ideas.

---

### 2. **Google Trends**

Use [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/) to see what people are searching for over time.

You can:

- Compare topics (e.g., “Branded mugs” vs “Customized mugs”)
- Identify **seasonal trends** (e.g., “gift mugs” spike in December)
- Filter by **location** to find what’s trending in your country or city

**Tip:** Focus on keywords that show consistent or rising interest over time.

## 🧩 What to Look For in Keywords

When choosing your target keywords, balance these three factors:

| Factor                       | Description                                  | Example                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Search Volume**            | How many people search for this term monthly | “Custom mugs” = 10k searches          |
| **Competition (Difficulty)** | How hard it is to rank for that keyword      | “Mugs” = High competition             |
| **Search Intent**            | What the user wants to achieve               | “Buy mugs online” = commercial intent |

:::tip
Aim for **long-tail keywords** specific, lower-competition phrases that attract high-intent visitors.
