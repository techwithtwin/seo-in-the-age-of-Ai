# Keyword Research

**Keyword research** is the process of finding and analyzing the words and phrases people use when searching online.

It helps you understand **what your audience wants**, and **how** they’re searching for it so you can create content that meets their intent.

> In simple terms: Keyword research helps you speak the same language as your customers.

## Why Keyword Research Matters

Search engines use keywords to match content with search queries.  
If your website includes the right keywords naturally in your content, titles, and metadata, you increase your chances of appearing in relevant searches.

Without keyword research, you’re basically guessing what your audience wants.

## How to Do Keyword Research

### 1. **Manual Research**

Start by typing your main product or service into Google and observe:

- **Autocomplete suggestions** (what Google predicts)
- **Related searches** (shown at the bottom of the page)
- **People also ask** boxes

These are real, data-backed search phrases that people are using right now.

**Example:**  
If you sell mugs, try typing:

> “Mugs for…” → Google may suggest _“Mugs for gifts”, “Mugs for office”, “Mugs for couples”_, etc.

Those are your potential keyword ideas.

### 2. **Google Trends**

Use [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/) to see what people are searching for over time.

You can:

- Compare topics (e.g., “Branded mugs” vs “Customized mugs”)
- Identify **seasonal trends** (e.g., “gift mugs” spike in December)
- Filter by **location** to find what’s trending in your country or city

**Tip:** Focus on keywords that show consistent or rising interest over time.

## What to Look For in Keywords

When choosing your target keywords, balance these three factors:

| Factor                       | Description                                  | Example                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Search Volume**            | How many people search for this term monthly | “Custom mugs” = 10k searches          |
| **Competition (Difficulty)** | How hard it is to rank for that keyword      | “Mugs” = High competition             |
| **Search Intent**            | What the user wants to achieve               | “Buy mugs online” = commercial intent |

:::tip
Aim for **long-tail keywords** specific, lower-competition phrases that attract high-intent visitors.
:::

> Example: Instead of “mugs,” target “branded mugs in Nairobi” or “custom printed mugs Kenya.”
